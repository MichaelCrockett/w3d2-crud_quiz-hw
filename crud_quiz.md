CRUD-QUIZ homework (17/9/2019)
```
Q1. Where are we instantiating instances of the Property class?
Lines 16-29 of console.rb
```
```
Q2. Where are we defining the SQL that enables us to save the ruby Property object into the database?
Lines 16-34 of property.rb
```
```
Q3. In console.rb, which lines modify the database?
Lines 31-39
```
```
Q4. Why do we not define the id of a Property object at the point we instantiate it (‘new it up’)?
SQL will generate an id automatically - it is a PRIMARY KEY
```
```
Q5. Where and how do we assign the id (that is generated by the database) to the ruby Property object?
Line 9 of property.rb
```
```
Q6. Why do we put a guard (an if clause) on the @id attribute in the constructor?
To change it from a string to an integer
```
```
Q7. Why are some of the CRUD actions represented by instance methods, and others by class methods?
Class methods deal with the whole of a given row/column
Instance methods deal with single pieces of data within a row
```
```
Q8. What type of data structure is returned by calls to db.exec_prepared()? In the save method, how do we access the id from the returned data structure?
An array of hashes. We access it with the SQL script RETURNING id
```
```
Q9. Why do we use prepared statements when performing database operations?
For security.  To guard against SQL injection attacks, where users try to enter SQL statements from the public side of a database interface.
```


Extension Questions
Look at the find_by_id and find_by_address methods in the Property class.


```
Q10. What do they take in as their arguments?

The id of the property object being searched for, and the address of the property object being searched for.
```
```
Q11. What are their return values?

In find, the return value is the first and only item in the db.exec_prepared method's returned value, which has been assigned to a new hash called results_array and the value has been reassigned to the found_property variable.  Returns as a database row(hash)

In find_by_address, same again - the return value is the first and only item in the db.exec_prepared method's returned value, which has been assigned to a new hash called results_array and the value has been reassigned to the found_property variable.  Returns as a database row(hash)

Identical answers?  Really? They must be wrong!
